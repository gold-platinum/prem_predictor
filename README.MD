This program was developed by Venkat Saharsh Pasupuleti for AP CSP summer homework

Attempting to predict Premier League games using pre-match data.

## Results
XGBoost Model with 40% model accuracy

## Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.
Install the required packages
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage
Run the program using
```python sample.py```

When prompted: 
Home Team: Enter the full name of the home team
Example: Manchester City

Away Team: Enter the full name of the away team
Example: Arsenal
